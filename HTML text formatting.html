    <blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU47nhruN-Q">Mitsuha Miyamizu is a high school student in the rural town of Itomori, Japan.
         Bored of the town, she wished to be a Tokyo boy in her life. Soon, she begins to intermittently switch bodies with Taki Tachibana, a boy from Tokyo. On certain days, Taki and Mitsuha wake up in each other's
        bodies and must live the full day as the other one, reverting when they go to sleep at night. The two set up ground rules for sharing their bodies,
        communicating via messages on paper, their phones, and their skin. Mitsuha (in Taki's body) sets Taki up on a date with his coworker Miki Okudera, while Taki (in Mitsuha's body) helps Mitsuha become more popular at school.
         While in Mitsuha's body, Taki accompanies Mitsuha's grandmother Hitoha and younger sister Yotsuha to the Shinto shrine on a mountain near Itomori, leaving an offering of kuchikamizake made with Mitsuha's spit.
         Hitoha explains that god is the ruler over both time and the connections between humans. Mitsuha tells Taki that the comet Tiamat is expected to pass nearest to Earth on the day of the autumn festival. 
        The next day, Taki goes on the date with Miki in his own body; Miki enjoys the date, but says she can tell Taki he is preoccupied with someone else. Realizing he is falling for Mitsuha, Taki attempts to call her on the phone, but cannot reach her.
         The body-switching stops as inexplicably as it started. </blockquote>
         <p>The message of the flim is that <q>It's mainly just a fictional story, it isn't anything that should be taken literally, but the main message is love (like many other anime movies).
            It's a lot abobut spirituality and destiny and the will to fight destiny to save the people you love most.</q></p>
